# Cross-compile the release binaries into dist/ and write SHA256SUMS.
#
# Both halves of the release run this: the job that opens the release PR, to
# get the checksums it pins into the bootstrap, and the job that publishes,
# to prove those pins still describe the binaries it is about to upload. That
# only holds while the toolchain is identical in both runs, so the workflow
# pins an exact Go version — the one printed below is what makes the build
# reproducible.
